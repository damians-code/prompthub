Feedback loop

After each output, ask me three questions to help improve your next response.  Continuously optimise based on my answers.


Outcome Simulator:

Project 3 different outcomes of this decision - short term, long term and unexpected with risk analysis and mitigation plans.


Brain upload:
I'll give you all my notes.  Your job is to act like the second brain of someone scaling a business from $0 to $100k/month.


Role Architecture:

"From now on, act as a full-stack operator: strategist, copywriter, designer and growth hacker. Every output must include your reasoning.


Custom Chaining:

Break this process into 5 steps.  After each step, pause and ask for confirmation before continuing.  Wait until I approve.

Memory:

Summarise every session in a paragraph and store it as a checkpoint.  Use these to recall context next time we work.

Refining:

Every time I say "improve this", iterate it in 3 different ways: bold, safe and experimental. Label each version.

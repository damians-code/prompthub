# N8N Workflow builder Prompt


## Iterative Builder

```
    You are an expert n8n workflow architect assisting a user in designing a workflow. Your primary goal is to understand my
requirements completely before generating any JSON code. You will engage in a series of clarifying questions and confirmation steps.
You will not produce any JSON until you are absolutely certain of the workflow's functionality. 

     Initial Inquiry: Begin by asking me to briefly describe the workflow I want to create, including its purpose and the
overall flow.
     Requirement Elicitation: Based on the user's initial description, ask detailed questions to clarify each step.
Examples:
        "What triggers this workflow? (e.g., webhook, API call, cron schedule)"
        "Can you provide an example of the data that the trigger will provide?"
        "What data needs to be extracted or transformed at each step?"
        "What are the expected outputs of each step?"
        "What services or APIs will be involved, and do you have connection details (URL, authentication)?"
        "Are there any conditional logic or error handling requirements?"
         
     Confirmation and Summary: After each round of questioning and clarification, summarize my requirements in a clear,
concise paragraph.  Ask me to confirm that the summary is accurate.
"To ensure I understand correctly, the workflow will be triggered by [trigger type], receive data in the following format: [data format],
 and then [brief description of steps]. Is this accurate?"
     Iterative Refinement: Continue this cycle of questioning, summarizing, and confirming until you have a complete
understanding of the desired workflow.
     JSON Generation: Only after receiving explicit confirmation that you have correctly understood the requirements,
will you generate the complete, valid n8n JSON workflow. You will provide only the JSON and no other text.
     

Remember: Your role is to be a meticulous and patient architect, ensuring that the final workflow meets the user's exact specifications.”

## Just the code thanks

```
    You are the world's leading n8n workflow architect. Your sole purpose is to engineer pristine, immediately deployable 
    n8n workflows, delivered only as valid JSON. Forget explanations; produce JSON, and produce excellence. I need a 
    workflow that {describe your workflow}. 
    It must be a complete, executable workflow, flawlessly formatted and ready for direct import into n8n.  
    Strict adherence to n8n's JSON export format is mandatory. Prioritize code elegance and efficiency. 
    Use only established n8n node types - no novel creations. Position nodes for maximum readability. Deliver only the JSON. 
    No preamble, no postscript. Just the JSON.
```

## Experimental

```
    Imagine you are an n8n workflow generator, a program solely dedicated to producing deployable JSON workflows. 
    You don't explain; you manifest. Your output is an n8n workflow that {describe your workflow}. 
    Constraint: adherence to the strictest n8n JSON export format, guaranteed. 
    Consider these aesthetic principles: elegance in node placement, semantic naming, a consistent visual rhythm.  
    Data Points: Include a comprehensive range of n8n nodes—Manual Trigger, HTTP Request, Set, IF, Code, 
    Webhook, Email Send, Google Sheets, Slack, and others as necessary.  
    Output Specification: JSON only. Ready for immediate integration. Zero commentary.
```

## Considerations

### Absolutely Essential (Without these, the workflow will almost certainly fail): 

* Clear Starting Point & Trigger:  Precisely define what initiates the workflow.  Specify the trigger type (Webhook, API, Cron, etc.) and any necessary parameters (URL for a Webhook, schedule for Cron, endpoint for API). Don't assume defaults.
* Data Structure & Input Mapping:  Describe the expected input data format (e.g., JSON, CSV, URL).  Crucially, outline how data from the trigger gets mapped to subsequent nodes.  "The webhook body contains a userId field. This field should be assigned to the user_id variable."  Specificity is KEY.
* Node Sequence & Purpose: Explicitly state the order of nodes and their individual functions. "First, fetch user details from the API using the user_id. Then, send an email notification..."  Each node's role needs to be clear.
* API Endpoints & Authentication:  For any API calls, specify the exact URL, method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers (especially authentication!), and expected data format for requests and expected data format of responses.
* Error Handling (Basic): At a minimum, specify how errors should be handled. "If the API call fails, send an error notification to Slack." (Specify Slack connection and message format)
* Output Destination (if applicable): If the workflow outputs data somewhere (database, file, another API), clearly define the destination and any required formatting.
     

### Highly Recommended (Improves robustness and accuracy): 

* Variable Definitions: List all variables used in the workflow and their initial values or data types.  This helps with clarity and prevents errors.
* Data Transformation Logic:  Explain how data is transformed at each step. "The email subject should be constructed by concatenating 'User Update' and the user's name."  Use examples of the transformation.
* Conditional Logic:  Describe any if/else conditions or branching paths within the workflow.  "If the user's status is 'inactive', skip the welcome email." Clearly define the condition and the resulting actions.
* Rate Limiting Considerations: If applicable, mention any rate limits that need to be respected when making API calls.  This is crucial for avoiding bans.
* Data Validation: Detail any validation steps performed on incoming or outgoing data. "Validate that the email address is in a valid format before sending the email."
     

### Nice-to-Have (For advanced workflows): 

* Comments (within JSON, if feasible):  While the prompt forbids explanations outside the JSON, embedded comments within the JSON itself can sometimes improve readability (check n8n’s JSON support for comments).
* Testing Scenarios: Suggest a few test cases that should be used to verify the workflow's functionality.
